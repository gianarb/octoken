octoken is a Go library written to generate and validate authentication token.

## Why

I wrote this library because token generation is a common problem I had to
solve continuously for every project I develop.

## Inspired by GitHub

I like to learn and reuse cool solutions. I tend to avoid custom solution when
I can because there are a lot of smart people studying and sharing their
solution, very often I can't come up with something better on my own.

I think token generation is one of those.

A few years ago I read ["Behind GitHubâ€™s new authentication token
formats"](https://github.blog/2021-04-05-behind-githubs-new-authentication-token-formats/)
from the GitHub technical blog, we implemented a similar solution in a project
and it is working since then.

Recently I had the same problem again in a different project and I decided to
write this solution as standalone library.

## Documentation

Have a look at godocs for this library where you can find the API documentation and a few examples.
